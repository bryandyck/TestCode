Fixed:
Print Problems
- ismul in MulDivNode (to reorder) 
- bad parenthesis
Parse Problems
- effective problem in addition and multiplication associativity

Todo:
- if required a better paren removal in expressions
- more efficient dynamic code generation (see later article on Matrix Expressions)
- support for user defined functions in compiler (require more arguments in generated class)
- multiple variable compiler

Added:
- comparision operators : < > != <= >= == (NOT DERIVABLE)
- logical operators: && || ! (NOT DERIVABLE)
- custom functions through delegate (NOT DERIVABLE and NOT COMPILED)
